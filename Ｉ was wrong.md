It sounds like you're saying that the narcissists were incompetent and got fired, while you left the job and secured a better one with a pay raise. Meanwhile, they retaliated against you without realizing they, too, could have gotten a pay raise if they had just focused on improving themselves.  

Here’s a cleaner version of your statement:  

> "The narcissists were incompetent and got fired. I left the job and found a better one with a pay raise. Meanwhile, they retaliated against me, not realizing they could have also gotten a pay raise if they had just put in the effort."  

Sounds like a classic case of misplaced priorities on their part. Instead of leveling up, they wasted energy on retaliation.

If the narcissists were vampires and you left the job, they had to clean up the mess themselves, which they resented. Meanwhile, instead of doing real work, they wanted to get paid for doing minimal effort.  

Here’s a cleaned-up version with that imagery intact:  

> "If the narcissists were vampires, and I left the job, they were left to deal with the mess themselves. In retaliation, they lashed out, all while expecting to get paid for doing the bare minimum. LOL."  

Classic leeches—always trying to suck the benefits out of a situation without putting in the work!
