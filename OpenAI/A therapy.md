# A therapy

Interesting question! I will explore the characteristics and behaviors of narcissistic therapists, how they might impact their clients, and signs to watch for if a therapist exhibits narcissistic tendencies. Additionally, I will look into professional ethics and what clients can do if they suspect their therapist is narcissistic. I'll get back to you with the findings soon.

## When a Narcissist Becomes a Therapist

### Introduction  
Narcissistic personality traits – characterized by grandiosity, a constant need for admiration, and lack of empathy – can manifest in any profession ([
            Narcissistic Personality Disorder in Clinical Health Psychology Practice: Case Studies of Comorbid Psychological Distress and Life-Limiting Illness - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5819598/#:~:text=Narcissistic%20Personality%20Disorder%20,working%20with%20NPD%20within%20the)). In the therapy field, most clinicians are ethical and caring, but a small subset may have unhealthy narcissistic tendencies ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=Just%20as%20the%20lives%20of,and%20pride%20in%20one%E2%80%99s%20work)). Such individuals might be drawn to the **powerful position** of a therapist, where the client is expected to share openly while the therapist maintains control ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=What%20makes%20a%20therapist%20want,to%20be%20a%20therapist)). This report examines the psychological traits of narcissistic individuals who enter the therapy profession, how a narcissistic therapist can impact clients, warning signs of narcissistic behavior in therapists, related ethical concerns, and steps clients can take if they suspect their therapist is narcissistic. Insights are supported by psychological research and professional guidelines.

### Psychological Traits of Narcissistic Individuals in the Therapy Profession  
**Grandiosity and Ego Gratification:** Narcissistic therapists often exhibit an inflated sense of self-importance and see the therapist role as an opportunity for ego reinforcement. Research suggests that a **narcissistic dimension is not uncommon among health professionals** like psychotherapists, possibly because helping others can gratify their ego needs ([
            Dropout and narcissism: an exploratory research about situational factors and personality variables of the psychotherapist - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7451389/#:~:text=narcissistic%20dimension%20is%20one%20of,can%20be%20considered%20as%20support)). In other words, the therapy setting may feed a narcissist’s desire to feel special or powerful. They may fantasize about being the *“guru”* or savior for clients, reflecting the narcissistic fantasy of unlimited power or knowledge ([
            Narcissistic Personality Disorder in Clinical Health Psychology Practice: Case Studies of Comorbid Psychological Distress and Life-Limiting Illness - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5819598/#:~:text=Narcissistic%20Personality%20Disorder%20,working%20with%20NPD%20within%20the)).

**Need for Admiration and Recognition:** A narcissistic individual who becomes a therapist might be highly invested in being seen as the best or most influential healer. They crave praise and may choose the profession to receive constant positive regard from vulnerable clients. Psychologist Mark Banschick notes that **unhealthy narcissism in a therapist is marked by an endless preoccupation with oneself and one’s image**, rather than genuine care for others ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=Yes%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20good%20thing,preoccupation%20and%20promotion)). These therapists might boast about their skills or degrees during sessions, fishing for admiration.

**Altruism as a Mask:** Some narcissists present as exceptionally caring or self-sacrificing – a guise sometimes called the **“altruistic” or “hero” narcissist**. They appear eager to rescue or “fix” others, not purely out of compassion, but to be viewed as a hero who is admired and indispensable ([What is an altruistic narcissist?](https://www.mentalhealth.com/library/what-is-altruistic-narcissist#:~:text=,sacrifices%20they%20have%20made%20to)). For example, such a therapist might go to great lengths to solve a client’s problems, only to later remind the client of how much they’ve sacrificed or how “lucky” the client is to have them. This hero complex feeds into their need for appreciation and control over the client’s dependence ([What is an altruistic narcissist?](https://www.mentalhealth.com/library/what-is-altruistic-narcissist#:~:text=,sacrifices%20they%20have%20made%20to)).

**Lack of Empathy:** A defining psychological trait of narcissism is impaired empathy, and this can carry over into the therapy room. While a healthy therapist can step into a client’s shoes, a narcissistic therapist struggles to truly care about the client’s feelings. Their focus remains on **their own perspective and ego**, often at the expense of understanding the client. In extreme cases, they might even feel contemptuous or impatient toward clients’ emotions, viewing clients’ struggles as inconveniences or challenges to the therapist’s expertise.

**Underlying Insecurities and Unmet Needs:** It’s worth noting that many therapists enter the field due to personal history or unmet emotional needs (e.g. a desire to heal others to heal themselves). In narcissistic therapists, these unresolved issues might include childhood wounds or insecurities that drive them to seek validation through the therapist role ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=Many%20therapists%20go%20into%20the,walks%20of%20life%2C%20and%20backgrounds)). For instance, a therapist who felt powerless or ignored in early life might overcompensate by wielding authority in therapy. Without self-awareness or personal healing, these individuals may use clients to fulfill their own needs for importance, love, or control ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=Look%20at%20any%20profession,and%20limitations%3B%20whereas%20others%20don%E2%80%99t)) ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=Many%20therapists%20go%20into%20the,walks%20of%20life%2C%20and%20backgrounds)). A healthy therapist recognizes these personal motives and keeps them in check, but a narcissistic therapist may not, leading to problematic behavior.

### How a Narcissistic Therapist Might Impact Their Clients  
**Erosion of Trust and Emotional Safety:** Empathy is the cornerstone of a strong therapeutic alliance, and without it, clients cannot feel safe or understood ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=Just%20like%20any%20narcissist%2C%20a,attempt%20to%20rationalize%20the%20abuse)). Narcissistic therapists, by virtue of low empathy, may **invalidate or trivialize their clients’ feelings**. For example, if a client shares pain or trauma, a narcissistic counselor might respond with impatience or blame, saying things like “You’re overreacting” or implying the client brought problems on themselves. Such responses can be deeply damaging – survivors report being *shamed or even yelled at for crying* by narcissistic therapists ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=SURVIVOR%20STORIES)) ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20went%20to%20my%20narcissistic,%E2%80%9D%20Stephanie)). This kind of emotional abuse in therapy re-traumatizes clients instead of healing them. It undermines the trust needed for clients to be vulnerable, often causing them to shut down or prematurely leave therapy.

**Exploitation and Boundary Violations:** In extreme cases, a narcissistic therapist may exploit the inherent power imbalance of the therapeutic relationship for personal gain. The most egregious example is **sexual involvement with clients**, a gross ethical violation and form of abuse ([ETHICS AND THE NARCISSISTIC THERAPIST](https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/2024-08/narcissistic.art_.pdf#:~:text=some%20exploitative%20fashion,writing)). Other exploitative behaviors include using clients for money, free labor, or personal advancement. David Wexler, Ph.D., describes how a narcissistic therapist might subtly send the message *“It is your job to make sure I feel good about myself”* – effectively using the client to meet the therapist’s emotional needs ([ETHICS AND THE NARCISSISTIC THERAPIST](https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/2024-08/narcissistic.art_.pdf#:~:text=The%20message%20that%20the%20patient,confidant%2C%20sexual%20partner%2C%20admirer%2C%20or)). Clients may feel pressured to praise the therapist, conform to the therapist’s opinions, or even perform favors to keep the therapist happy. This **role reversal** (where the client feels responsible for the therapist) is psychologically damaging; it echoes the dynamic of a narcissistic parent who demands a child boost the parent’s ego ([ETHICS AND THE NARCISSISTIC THERAPIST](https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/2024-08/narcissistic.art_.pdf#:~:text=The%20message%20that%20the%20patient,confidant%2C%20sexual%20partner%2C%20admirer%2C%20or)). Clients subjected to such treatment can experience confusion, guilt, and a worsening of self-esteem.

**Impaired Therapeutic Outcomes:** Narcissistic behavior by a therapist often leads to poor treatment results. A healthy therapeutic alliance requires collaboration and respect, but a narcissistic clinician’s self-centered approach damages this alliance. Research indicates that when a therapist has high narcissistic traits, their ability to empathize and attune to the client’s needs is compromised, which can **harm the therapy process** ([
            Dropout and narcissism: an exploratory research about situational factors and personality variables of the psychotherapist - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7451389/#:~:text=test%20the%20therapist%E2%80%99s%20narcissistic%20integrity,has%20an%20empathetic%20approach%20in)). One study found that therapists with lower narcissism showed greater sensitivity to clients’ emotions (like sadness) and built stronger alliances, whereas those with higher narcissistic tendencies experienced more therapy failures and client dropouts ([
            Dropout and narcissism: an exploratory research about situational factors and personality variables of the psychotherapist - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7451389/#:~:text=narcissistic%20dimension%20of%20the%20therapist%2C,for%20group%20A%20in)). Clients of narcissistic therapists may make slower progress or even regress. Some report leaving therapy feeling worse than when they started – for instance, feeling **re-traumatized, invalidated, or full of self-doubt** after repeated criticism and gaslighting from a narcissistic counselor ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=authority%20and%20power%20by%20haughtily,the%20healing%20process%2C%20causing%20retraumatization)) ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=therapeutic%20alliance,of%20it%20from%20unethical%20professionals)). In the worst scenarios, vulnerable clients might stay and become increasingly dependent on the toxic therapist, losing confidence in their own judgment as the therapist systematically undermines it ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=authority%20and%20power%20by%20haughtily,the%20healing%20process%2C%20causing%20retraumatization)).

**Emotional Manipulation and Gaslighting:** Narcissistic therapists can also manipulate clients’ perceptions. They might **gaslight** – deny or distort the client’s reality – especially if a client questions the therapist’s methods or behavior. For example, if a client feels hurt by something the therapist said and brings it up, a narcissistic therapist might dismiss the concern as “misinterpreting” or even blame the client for being too sensitive. There are accounts of **toxic therapists siding with abusers** in cases of abuse therapy, effectively joining in the gaslighting of the victim ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=Just%20like%20any%20narcissist%2C%20a,attempt%20to%20rationalize%20the%20abuse)) ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20had%20a%20therapist%20tell,%E2%80%9DWendy)). This not only invalidates the client’s experiences but can deepen the trauma, making the client feel utterly alone or even at fault for their own abuse. The impact is a devastating betrayal of the client’s trust and can have long-term consequences on the client’s mental health and willingness to seek help in the future.

**Creating Dependency:** Another detrimental impact is fostering unhealthy dependency. A narcissistic therapist may *position themselves as the client’s only source of help*, discouraging the client from seeking support elsewhere. They might implicitly or explicitly **isolate the client from other sources of support** – for instance, by dismissing the client’s friends or family advice, or warning that “other therapists won’t understand you like I do.” This cult-like dynamic is deliberate: by monopolizing the client’s support system, the narcissistic therapist secures a steady supply of admiration and control ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=encourage%20you%20to%20consult%20other,you%20become%20increasingly%20dependent%20on)). Over time, the client can develop *learned helplessness*, feeling they cannot make decisions or validate their experiences without the therapist’s input ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=perspectives%2C%20getting%20a%20second%20opinion%2C,resist%20the%20therapist%E2%80%99s%20gaslighting%20attempts)) ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=power%20over%20every%20facet%20of,resist%20the%20therapist%E2%80%99s%20gaslighting%20attempts)). This deepens the client’s dependence and allows the therapist greater influence, often to the client’s detriment. Instead of empowering the client (a key goal of therapy), the narcissistic clinician **keeps the client small and reliant**, stalling genuine progress.

### Signs a Therapist May Exhibit Narcissistic Tendencies  
While no therapist is perfect, certain **red flags** can indicate a pattern of narcissistic behavior. Here are some warning signs to watch for:

- **Chronic Boundary Violations:** The therapist habitually crosses professional boundaries. For example, they may reveal excessively personal information, **turn sessions into discussions about their own life**, or engage in inappropriate dual relationships. In extreme cases, they might flirt with or make sexual advances toward clients – a clear violation of ethics ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=Perhaps%20the%20most%20telling%20sign,the%20narcissistic%20partner%20in%20question)) ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=An%20unethical%20therapist%20may%20cross,by%20sexually%20abusing%20their%20clients)). Constantly running over session time for their own storytelling, or contacting the client outside of sessions for personal reasons, also falls into this category of boundary crossing ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=practice%2C%20should%20always%20be%20oriented,emotional%20needs%20of%20the%20practitioner)). Healthy therapists maintain clear boundaries; narcissistic ones feel entitled to bend the rules for their own needs.

- **Lack of Empathy and Compassion:** A narcissistic therapist often shows little genuine empathy. They might dismiss or minimize your feelings, seem annoyed by your struggles, or even engage in **victim-blaming and shaming** ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=Just%20like%20any%20narcissist%2C%20a,attempt%20to%20rationalize%20the%20abuse)). For instance, if you express pain or vulnerability, they may respond with statements that make you feel judged or humiliated rather than supported. Some clients have reported that narcissistic therapists *mocked or belittled their pain* instead of validating it ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=Just%20like%20any%20narcissist%2C%20a,attempt%20to%20rationalize%20the%20abuse)). This lack of empathy can also manifest as impatience – the therapist might cut you off, change the subject when you’re upset, or push you to “get over” things without proper processing. Empathy is essential for therapy; its absence is a glaring red flag.

- **Self-Centered Focus:** Notice if the therapist frequently makes the session about themselves. Narcissistic therapists tend to **dominate conversations with their own stories or opinions**, showing little interest in the client’s perspective. They may interrupt to brag about their achievements or credentials, or relate every issue back to their personal experiences. Another sign is distractibility or disrespect during sessions – for example, **answering phone calls or texts in session** and not giving you their full attention ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=,exploits%20you%20in%20some%20way)). Such behavior indicates that the therapist prioritizes their own life and ego above the client’s therapeutic work. Similarly, if the therapist often highlights how *special or expert* they are (perhaps hinting that you’re lucky to have them), it suggests a need for admiration. **Needing constant praise** or fishing for compliments from clients (e.g., “Aren’t you grateful for all I’ve done for you?”) is indicative of narcissism in a therapist ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=,exploits%20you%20in%20some%20way)).

- **Arrogance and Superiority:** Narcissistic practitioners typically act as if they have all the answers. They can be **haughty, condescending, and unable to tolerate disagreement** ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=5,and%20contemptuous)). If your therapist routinely talks down to you, dismisses your questions, or corrects you in a way that feels degrading, take note. They might use clinical jargon or their authority to intimidate or assert dominance. Another sign is that they **never admit mistakes or apologize** – a narcissistic therapist will deflect blame onto the client or others rather than acknowledge any fault. They may also claim a *“special” understanding or relationship* with you that other professionals wouldn’t, framing themselves as the only one who can help, which feeds their grandiosity ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=,exploits%20you%20in%20some%20way)). This attitude of “I know best, always” stifles the collaborative nature of healthy therapy.

- **Hypersensitivity to Criticism:** If a therapist has narcissistic tendencies, they often react poorly to feedback. Try raising a concern or disagreeing with them – a narcissistic therapist will likely become **defensive, angry, or emotionally hurt** in response ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=,a%20%E2%80%9Cspecial%E2%80%9D%20relationship%20with%20you)). For example, they might lash out if you question a technique (“Are you questioning my expertise?!”) or they might punish you subtly for challenging them (perhaps by coldly withdrawing in the next sessions or giving you lower-quality attention). A healthy therapist invites feedback and adapts; a narcissistic one **cannot handle being challenged** and may even retaliate or dismiss your feelings when confronted ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=,a%20%E2%80%9Cspecial%E2%80%9D%20relationship%20with%20you)). This fragility and insistence on their own rightness is a tell-tale sign of a narcissistic style.

- **Encouraging Dependence and Isolation:** Be wary if your therapist discourages you from seeking support outside of therapy or **tries to isolate you from other perspectives**. Narcissistic therapists sometimes act like *cult leaders*, wanting to be the sole influence over a client ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=Narcissistic%20therapists%20are%20very%20much,to%20wield%20complete%20and%20utter)). They might warn that family or friends “don’t understand you” or that consulting another professional would be a betrayal or pointless. Healthy therapists, by contrast, encourage strong social support and, when appropriate, are open to collaboration or second opinions. A narcissistic therapist who *insists you rely only on them* is likely more interested in controlling you than helping you become independent ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=encourage%20you%20to%20consult%20other,you%20become%20increasingly%20dependent%20on)). This manipulation serves to keep the client dependent and strokes the therapist’s ego as the all-important figure.

Not every difficult therapy moment indicates a narcissistic therapist – professionals are human and can have off days. However, **multiple persistent red flags** like those above should raise concern.

## Ethical Concerns and Professional Guidelines  
A therapist exhibiting narcissistic behaviors isn’t just a personal quirk – it’s a serious ethical issue. Professional ethics codes make it clear that the **therapist’s duty is to the client’s well-being, not the therapist’s ego**. For instance, the American Psychological Association’s ethics code explicitly states that **psychologists must not exploit individuals over whom they have authority, such as clients** ([ETHICS AND THE NARCISSISTIC THERAPIST](https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/2024-08/narcissistic.art_.pdf#:~:text=,this%20sort%20of%20exploitation%3A%20sexual)). This principle covers obvious exploitations (like sexual or financial abuse of clients) and more subtle forms of using clients to meet the therapist’s own emotional needs.

**Exploitation and Harm:** Narcissistic therapists risk violating multiple ethical standards. Sexual relationships with current clients are strictly forbidden in all mental health professions due to the inherent power imbalance and harm caused – this is a boundary narcissistic individuals might be more likely to cross given their sense of entitlement. Beyond sexual misconduct, **using a client for self-serving purposes** (such as free labor, social connections, or ego boosts) is unethical. The cases of therapists manipulating clients for insider information or personal favors, as mentioned by Wexler ([ETHICS AND THE NARCISSISTIC THERAPIST](https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/2024-08/narcissistic.art_.pdf#:~:text=therapist.,a%20patient%20to%20perform%20a)), illustrate blatant exploitation. Even when exploitation is subtle – for example, enjoying a client’s dependency or admiration a bit *too much* – it can cloud the therapist’s objectivity and lead to decisions that put the therapist’s needs first. Therapists are ethically required to avoid dual relationships or conflicts of interest that could impair their judgment or harm the client.

**Maintaining Boundaries:** Professional guidelines emphasize maintaining clear therapeutic boundaries. A narcissistic therapist’s tendency to blur boundaries (by oversharing, informal contact, etc.) **undermines the “therapeutic container,”** which is the structured environment needed for safe therapy ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=writes%3A)). According to clinical experts, therapy should generally occur in set conditions (appropriate setting, time limits, no unnecessary physical contact or out-of-session dealings) to protect clients ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=writes%3A)). Narcissistic therapists who ignore these guidelines risk causing dependency, confusion, and harm. Ethically, if a therapist finds themselves craving a client’s admiration or friendship, they should seek supervision or personal therapy rather than act it out. Self-awareness is crucial: **Therapists must monitor their own “countertransference”** – their emotional reactions and needs toward the client – to ensure they are serving the client’s interests, not their own. As Dr. Banschick points out, good therapists often undergo their own therapy or consultation to recognize and manage any unconscious tendencies to have their *own needs* met in sessions ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=Does%20that%20mean%20they%E2%80%99re%20unfit,to%20work)). Narcissistic therapists lacking this insight may let their unmet needs for validation or power intrude, which is unethical.

**Client Welfare and Competence:** The fundamental ethical principle is that the client’s welfare comes first. A narcissistic therapist violates this by prioritizing self. Professional standards also require competence – if a therapist’s narcissistic traits impede their empathy or judgment, they are not providing competent care. For example, a therapist who cannot tolerate client criticism might abandon or punish the client (as seen in some horror stories), which is a failure of professional responsibility. Ethical guidelines would urge such a therapist to **either correct their behavior or refer the client to another provider** for the client’s safety. Additionally, most licensing boards have rules about unprofessional conduct, which include harassment, discrimination, or emotional abuse of clients. A narcissistic therapist belittling a client or **shaming them is crossing ethical lines**, potentially engaging in emotional abuse under the guise of treatment.

**Accountability:** From an ethical standpoint, therapists are accountable for managing their personal issues. Narcissistic personality traits in a therapist, if unchecked, can lead to **misuse of power**. It’s incumbent on professionals to regularly engage in self-reflection, continue education, and, if needed, seek supervision to prevent unethical conduct. In practice, colleagues or supervisors who observe narcissistic behavior are encouraged to intervene or report it, aligning with ethical obligations to protect clients from harm. Unfortunately, truly narcissistic therapists may evade self-reflection, so it often falls to clients or external parties to raise concerns (which is a difficult burden on clients). This is why ethical training highlights the dangers of therapist narcissism: even **seemingly “small” narcissistic indulgences (like subtly pressuring a client to praise the therapist)** can snowball into significant client harm ([ETHICS AND THE NARCISSISTIC THERAPIST](https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/2024-08/narcissistic.art_.pdf#:~:text=The%20term%20narcissistic%2C%20in%20this,In%20self)) ([ETHICS AND THE NARCISSISTIC THERAPIST](https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/2024-08/narcissistic.art_.pdf#:~:text=even%20for%20those%20of%20us,or%20patient)). Professional associations remind therapists to always ask themselves, *“Am I doing this for the client’s benefit or mine?”* — a question designed to check narcissistic impulses ([ETHICS AND THE NARCISSISTIC THERAPIST](https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/2024-08/narcissistic.art_.pdf#:~:text=The%20term%20narcissistic%2C%20in%20this,In%20self)). When the answer is “for me,” the therapist must course-correct immediately to uphold ethical practice.

### Steps for Clients Who Suspect Their Therapist is Narcissistic  
Discovering that your therapist may have narcissistic tendencies can be disorienting and frightening, especially if you entered therapy seeking help and instead feel harmed. Here are steps you can consider to protect yourself and address the situation:

1. **Trust Your Observations and Feelings:** First, recognize the red flags. If you consistently feel worse about yourself after sessions, dread your appointments, or notice many of the warning signs listed above, **trust your gut**. It’s not your imagination if your therapist is violating boundaries, shaming you, or making therapy about them. Acknowledging the problem is important; many clients hesitate because they assume “the therapist knows best.” Remember that **no ethical therapist will consistently make you feel small, unsafe, or exploited**. Your feelings of discomfort are valid data.

2. **Seek Outside Perspective:** It can help to get a second opinion or talk to a trusted person about what’s happening (without breaching your own confidentiality beyond what you’re comfortable sharing). You might describe the therapist’s behavior to a friend, another therapist (perhaps in a consultation session), or a support group (there are communities for those who’ve experienced therapist abuse). Hearing an outside perspective can validate your concerns and clarify that the behavior is indeed inappropriate. **Knowledge is empowering** – resources on narcissistic abuse or consultations with ethical professionals can reinforce that *you are not overreacting*. For example, psychotherapist Mark Banschick advises clients to **evaluate a therapist as you would any professional** service: if you observe clear signs of narcissism, you have every right to consider finding someone else ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=Ironically%2C%20too%20many%20people%20quickly,be%20unhappy%20with%20being%20questioned)).

3. **Set Boundaries and Don’t Personalize the Blame:** If you’re not ready to leave the therapist immediately, at least start setting firmer personal boundaries. You might stop appeasing their ego – for instance, avoid giving excessive praise or personal information that isn’t relevant to your treatment. Remind yourself that **any feelings of obligation to soothe or please the therapist are a result of their manipulation**. A healthy therapeutic relationship never requires the client to take care of the therapist’s feelings. Try to keep interactions strictly professional and document for yourself any incidents that feel wrong (this can be useful if you later decide to report the behavior). Importantly, do not blame yourself for the therapist’s actions; their narcissism is *their issue*, not a failing on your part.

4. **Consider Confronting the Therapist (If Safe):** In some cases, it might be possible to address your concerns directly. This step is delicate – many narcissistic individuals react poorly to confrontation. However, if you believe your therapist might be simply unaware of an issue (and not deeply narcissistic), or if you feel safe doing so, you could **bring up what’s bothering you**. For example, you might say, “I notice that sometimes our sessions focus a lot on your stories, and I feel my concerns get less attention.” A competent, non-narcissistic therapist will likely apologize and adjust, appreciating the feedback. As one expert notes, *“The good ones will help you feel at ease. The impaired ones will be unhappy with being questioned.”* ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=evaluate%20your%20therapist%2C%20just%20like,be%20unhappy%20with%20being%20questioned)). Pay attention to the response: if the therapist becomes defensive, angry, or dismissive, that confirms a problematic dynamic ([The Narcissistic Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201311/the-narcissistic-therapist#:~:text=evaluate%20your%20therapist%2C%20just%20like,be%20unhappy%20with%20being%20questioned)). You are never obligated to confront, especially if you feel it’s unsafe – it’s an option, not a requirement.

5. **Seek a New Therapist:** You have the right to terminate therapy if it’s harmful. **Protect your well-being by finding a healthier therapeutic environment.** If possible, line up a new therapist (perhaps one who comes recommended for being empathetic or who specializes in trauma if you’ve been traumatized by the previous therapist). When you leave, you don’t owe the narcissistic therapist a detailed explanation – a simple statement of ending therapy is enough. Some clients fear angering or “hurting” the therapist by leaving; remember, a professional should handle termination appropriately. If they react inappropriately (begging you to stay, guilt-tripping you, or raging), that behavior only validates your decision to leave. Finding a new, supportive therapist can also help you **process the negative experience** with the narcissistic one. Healing from therapy abuse is important, as it can restore trust in the therapeutic process with the right person.

6. **Report Ethical Violations:** If your therapist’s behavior crossed ethical lines – such as sexual advances, financial exploitation, harassment, or serious emotional abuse – **you can file a complaint** with their licensing board or professional association. This is a significant step and can be emotionally taxing, but it may protect others in the future and hold the therapist accountable. Many jurisdictions have online forms or contacts for reporting unprofessional conduct of licensed mental health providers. You will typically need to provide details of what occurred; having notes or evidence helps. In one survivor’s account, after a therapist sent an inappropriate letter and caused harm, the client *“reported her to the state licensing board.”* ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20narcissistic%20mother%E2%80%99s%20therapist%20wrote,%E2%80%9DJane)). Boards will investigate claims and can sanction or revoke a therapist’s license if misconduct is confirmed. Even if you choose not to report, know that the option exists. Therapists are not above the law or ethics, and egregious violations should face consequences.

7. **Look After Your Own Healing:** Experiencing narcissistic abuse from a therapist can be traumatic. It’s vital to engage in self-care and seek support as you recover. This might include leaning on friends and family, joining support groups for therapy abuse survivors, or reading literature on narcissistic abuse to understand what you went through. If you switch therapists, be sure to mention the past experience so the new therapist can help rebuild your sense of trust at a comfortable pace. **You deserve a therapist who respects and empowers you.** Don’t let one bad therapist stop you from getting the help you need; many ethical, compassionate professionals are out there ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=Some%20narcissistic%20therapists%20go%20as,investing%20in%20another%20potential%20predator)). As PsychCentral notes, *knowing the red flags of a narcissistic therapist can save you time, energy, and heartache* – and now that you know them, you can move forward and find a truly supportive therapist ([5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists (The Ultimate Covert Wolves In Sheep's Clothing)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/5-signs-of-narcissistic-therapists-the-ultimate-covert-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing#:~:text=Some%20narcissistic%20therapists%20go%20as,investing%20in%20another%20potential%20predator)).

### Conclusion  
Narcissists who become therapists bring a dangerous mix of grandiosity and lack of empathy into a role that demands humility and compassion. Such therapists may seek the profession for self-serving reasons – craving admiration, authority, or validation – and their clients unfortunately suffer the consequences. The impact on clients can range from a corrosive erosion of self-worth to outright ethical violations and trauma. Recognizing the signs of a narcissistic therapist is crucial for clients to protect themselves. Ethical guidelines in mental health clearly oppose the exploitative and self-centered behaviors that narcissistic therapists exhibit, but enforcement often relies on awareness and reporting. 

If you suspect your therapist is narcissistic, remember that **you have options and rights**. Therapy is supposed to help *you*, and no client should tolerate treatment that consistently harms or invalidates them. By trusting your instincts, seeking supportive advice, setting boundaries, and if needed, finding a new therapist or reporting misconduct, you reclaim your power and well-being. In the end, a therapist should always foster your growth and autonomy – anything less, especially a dynamic of ego-driven control, is a sign to walk away. Your mental health journey is too important to be derailed by a narcissistic healer; with knowledge and courage, you can steer it back on course towards genuine healing and support.
