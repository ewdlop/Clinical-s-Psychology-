When narcissists marry each other, the dynamics of their relationship can be complex and volatile. Both partners often seek validation, admiration, and control, which can create a cycle of competition, conflict, and manipulation. Here are some potential scenarios and outcomes:

### 1. **Initial Attraction**
   - **Mutual Admiration:** At first, both narcissists may admire each other's confidence, charm, and social status.
   - **Shared Values:** They may bond over superficial values like appearance, success, or influence.

### 2. **Power Struggles**
   - **Competing for Dominance:** Both partners may strive to be the "center of attention," leading to conflicts.
   - **Control Issues:** Each may attempt to control the other, creating a toxic cycle of manipulation.

### 3. **Emotional Void**
   - **Lack of Empathy:** Both partners may struggle to provide emotional support or genuine understanding.
   - **Conditional Love:** Their affection may be contingent on receiving admiration and validation.

### 4. **Conflict Escalation**
   - **Frequent Arguments:** Disagreements can escalate quickly as both partners may lack the ability to compromise.
   - **Blame Games:** They may blame each other for failures or shortcomings, refusing to take responsibility.

### 5. **Public Image vs. Reality**
   - **Facade Maintenance:** They might maintain a picture-perfect relationship publicly while privately struggling.
   - **External Validation:** The marriage may revolve around how others perceive them rather than genuine connection.

### 6. **Potential Outcomes**
   - **Short-lived Union:** The relationship may end due to constant conflict and unmet emotional needs.
   - **Co-dependent Cycle:** Alternatively, they might stay together in a dysfunctional co-dependent pattern.
   - **Destructive Divorce:** If the marriage ends, it can involve vindictive behavior and prolonged legal battles.

### 7. **Impact on Others**
   - **Children:** If they have children, the lack of emotional availability and the toxic environment can deeply affect the kids.
   - **Friends & Family:** Their relationship might strain other relationships due to their drama and self-centeredness.

When narcissists marry, their relationship can highlight and amplify their personality traits, often leading to a turbulent and high-stakes dynamic.
